            The genus Felis diverged from other Felidae around 6–7 million years ago.[41] Results of phylogenetic research 
            confirm that the wild Felis species evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat 
            evolved through artificial selection.</p>
            
           <div calss="special"> 
               <p>The domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both 
            possess 38 chromosomes[43] and roughly 20,000 genes.[44] The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed 
            independently in China around 5500 BC. This line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic 
            cat populations of today</p>
